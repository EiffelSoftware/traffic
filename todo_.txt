all:
- add "traffic_" to all file and classnames using search and replace in eclipse
- are the classes in $TRAFFIC/library/*.e in the right place?
- check that all classes use gobo data structures

Travelers:
- Improve EM_OBJ_LOADER for more advanced file versions
- First person view walks
- Real itineraries and delays for trams
- Tram depots where all the trams start until they are on their route.
- Change default for TRAFFIC_LINE_TRAVELERS from TRAFFIC_TYPE tram 
- Drawing of deboard and board of TRAFFIC_PASSENGERs

Buildings:
- improve speed of randomly generated buildings
- randomize buildings along lines more
- randomize look and feel of buildings
- Fix surface normals of buildings (for lighting)

Shortest path:
- improve drawing of shortest_path (city 3d)

Map_widgets:
- 3d_widget: publish mouse events
- 3d_widget, representation, and factory classes: check contracts
- check whether all constants are constants
- Remove plane_size to be a constant and adapt map_to_gl_coords accordingly
- Design a better method of generating representations -->either reading 3D objects from a file or getting an OpenGL function generating a displaylist
- Remove TRAFFIC_3D_TRAVELER_REPRESENTATION and add for each of the TRAFFIC_MOVING subtypes a representation.
- Check that MVC is strictly followed
- Use map coordinates for drawing as well 
- Improve visualization of roads
- Use ARRAYED_LIST for TRAFFIC_3D_PLACE_REPRESENTATION as well (see TRAFFIC_3D_LINE_REPRESENTATION)
- Use ARRAYED_LIST for TRAFFIC_3D_ROAD_REPRESENTATION as well (see TRAFFIC_3D_LINE_REPRESENTATION)
- Use separate threads for handling mouse events (see Alan Fehr's report 5.3)
- Use logarithmic search for finding clicked places (see Alan Fehr's report 5.3)
- Improve random building generation (see Alan Fehr's report 5.3)


Performance:
- All representations should be stored in an arrayed list, keep the hash table for lookup
  iterating is faster this way, which is done every frame.

Visualization:
- Possibly refactor the representation factories into one class.

Map loading:
- improve error handling and messages
- use SAX parsing

Roads:
- Add more roads to xml
- Add the roads to the graph for path calculations
- Make PASSENGER walk on roads

Touch examples:
- improve console window to be scrollable and flashier
- Add example for "redefinition for efficiency" and "redefinition for correctness" (see Sarah Hauser's report 4.1.1)
- Add example for weakening and strengthening pre and postconditions (see Sarah Hauser's report 4.1.3)

Exercises:
- Event exercise: see Sarah Hauser's report 4.1.2

general:
- have gobo mounted into a subcluster
	-> This is being looked into by Eric from gobosoft, it is not possible at the moment
- rearrange the touch_examples into another directory

Documentation:
- Remove unneeded image files and make format of file names uniformly (only lowercase)
