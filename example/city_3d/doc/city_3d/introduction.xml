	<title>Purpose of this work</title>
	<para>
	The purpose of this work was to provide a 3
	dimensional visualization of a map from an XML file. 
	his map stores information about places and metro
	lines of a town, which should be displayed in an appropriate way. 
	</para>

<section id="goal">
	<title>Our goals</title>
	<para>
	Our goal was to implement a program that parses this
	map and generates the data structures, displays metro lines as
	colored polygons on a plane, adds houses on this plane
	randomly but checks for "collisions" with metro lines,
	provides useful mouse and keyboard support such that changing
	the viewport (zooming, rotation, different centres) should be
	possible (easily). Moreover different light settings should be
	implemented, existing features such as the shortest path
	algorithm, visualized and extended.

	<title>Structure of documentation</title>
	<para>
	The next part explaines the overall structure and all the used
	classes and factories with their features in detail. 
	Part three gives information about all the dependencies
	between the different classes. Besides it explaines which
	parts are depending on the information in the XML files and
	which features would have to be changed using a different one.
	Part four concentrates on the reuse of the MAP class and
	factories, using a different scene. It explains how options
	are set using the apropriate features and what would be to do
	going beyond changing only the scene.
	Finally, part five presents some ideas of what could be implemented in
	the future and how to embed it into the project.
