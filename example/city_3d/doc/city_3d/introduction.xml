	<title>Purpose of this work</title>
	<para>
	The purpose of this work was to provide a 3
	dimensional visualization of a map from an XML file. 
	This map contains information about places and traffic
	lines of a city, which should be displayed in an appropriate way.

	<title>Our goals</title>
	<para>
	Our goal was to implement a program that parses this
	map file and generates the data structures, displays traffic lines as
	colored polygons on a plane, adds buildings on this plane
	randomly but checks for "collisions" with traffic lines,
	provides useful mouse and keyboard support such that changing
	the viewport (zooming, rotation, different centres) should be
	possible (easily). Moreover different light settings should be
	implemented, existing features such as the shortest path
	algorithm, integrateted and visualized.

	<ulink url="miscellaneous.html">Part three</ulink> gives information about all the dependencies
	between the different classes. Besides it explaines which
	parts are depending on the information in the XML files and
	which features would have to be changed using different ones. Moreover it discusses some possible reuse scenarios of our work. It explains how control options
	are added to the GUI and what would have to be done if one would like to change more than just the GUI. Finally, it presents some ideas of what could be implemented in
	the future and how to embed it into the project.
