    	TOUCH is the second application that is delivered to you. 
			TOUCH implements some of the examples of the book ''Touch of Class''. 
			Note that the examples as described in TOUCH are not totally equivalent 
			to their description in the text book. At the time of this writing not 
			all the examples of the book are implemented yet. So TOUCH needs to be 
			taken with a pinch of salt!

				on the bottom left of the screen. Simply click on an example and some 
				information together with a picture will pop up on the right side. To see the example 
				in action use the <emphasis>run example</emphasis> button on the right. What
				happens after you pressed the button depends on the implementation of the 
				example, but in most of the examples you will get a screen like this
