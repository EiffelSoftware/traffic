<title>Touch Clusters</title>
<para>
This part describes the design and structure of the classes that build up <projectname>TOUCH</projectname>. This first chapter gives a short overview of the whole system. The next chapter describes each cluster and its most important classes. <emphasis>Figure 1</emphasis> shows the clusters as they are displayed in EiffelStudio. The clusters that are important for you to work with TOUCH are found in top-level cluster Touch. This cluster has itself four subclusters called examples, utils, visualization and widgets. These cluster are described in the next section.

<title>Clusters in detail</title>
<para>
Cluster Touch contains only a few classes. But one of them is probably the most important: <classname>TOUCH_EXAMPLE_SELECTION_SCENE</classname>. It is the main scene for TOUCH. The example registration and example selection is coded within this class. The mechanism of inserting new examples and exercises is explained in Chapter <link url="dev_build_example.html">Build a new Example</link>.

 	           <strong>Cluster Examples</strong>   This Cluster contains the classes used to build an example: The deferred class <classname>TOUCH_EXAMPLE</classname> and <classname>TOUCH_SIMPLE_TRAFFIC_SCENE</classname>. It also contains the class <classname>TOUCH_EXAMPLE_RUNTIME</classname> that provides the running example with access to the map etc. The implemented examples that come with the application can also be found here.

	           	<strong>Cluster Utils</strong>   In this cluster there are only three simple helper classes used for basic timing and for getting an unique id.

	            <strong>Cluster Visualization</strong>   Several classes that have to do with the graphical representation are contained in this cluster.

	            <strong>Cluster Widgets</strong>   Since the main part of this application was written before <libraryname>EiffelMedia</libraryname> was created, <projectname>TOUCH</projectname> comes with its own GUI-Widgets.
