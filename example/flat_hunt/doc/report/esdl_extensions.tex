Since I initially wanted to do my semester thesis on \emph{ESDL}, but then due to several circumstances ended up doing it on \emph{Flat Hunt}, I wanted to keep the option open to simultaneously develop \emph{ESDL} if needed for my project. So I named my thesis ``Flat Hunt Redesign and ESDL Extensions''.\\ 
As I made progress with my work it turned out that \emph{ESDL} already sufficed for \emph{Flat Hunt} in virtually every aspect. And then \emph{ESDL} was transformed into a new project called \emph{EiffelMedia} (\emph{EM}) which would be aggressively developed over summer by a number of people. \\
So basically what I did with \emph{ESDL} was use it, rather than extend it (except for fixing minor bugs which I ran across, but that does not count as an extension in my opinion).\\
In the end, I was relieved that \emph{ESDL}, or now \emph{EM}, already had such good support for everything I needed, because redesigning \emph{Flat Hunt} proved to be much more elaborate than I had imagined.
