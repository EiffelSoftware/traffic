    <para>
        <emphasis>Playing FLAT_HUNT is not very difficult, especially for those that know the game
            "Scotland Yard"…</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para> This chapter is structured in three sections. The first section describes the general
        rules of the game. Then the different modes are explained more precisely. The last section
        is about other stuff like how to start a new game. </para>

        <title>General Rules</title>
        <para> The game lasts for at most 23 rounds. In these 23 rounds, the flat hunters try to
            find the estate agent, while he tries to avoid them (this is because he would rather
            rent the flats to elderly couples, since presumably they make fewer parties in the
            middle of the night…). </para>
        <para> In each round, every player can make one move on the public transport system. The
            estate agent is the first, then it’s the hunters turn. One move is either </para>

            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para> one or two stops by tram (colored lines), </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para> one stop by train (thick black lines), </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para> or one stop by bus (thin dashed blue lines). </para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <para> A move with a certain transport can only be made if one has still enough tickets (see
            Figure 4), if there is a connection (obviously), and if there is no other player at that
            destination (and in the case of tram lines, if there is no hunter in between). </para>
        <para>
            <warning>Attention: If you are at a bus-only stop, and you run out of bus tickets, you
                will get stuck there forever, so be careful…</warning>
        </para>
        <para> The possible places one can move to have a blue highlighted outline (see Figure 5).
            To make a move, just click on one of those highlighted places. The red circle centers on
            the player whose turn it is, and in the information panel at the bottom, the current
            player’s tab is highlighted and you can see the player’s image. </para>
        <para> The game is over when <blockquote>
                <variablelist>
                    <varlistentry>
                        <term> a) the hunters could not find the estate agent within 23 rounds,
                        </term>
                    </varlistentry>
                    <varlistentry>
                        <term> b) one flat hunter moves onto the place where the agent currently is,
                        </term>
                    </varlistentry>
                    <varlistentry>
                        <term> c) or the hunters encircle the estate agent so that he cannot move
                            anymore. </term>
                    </varlistentry>
                </variablelist>
            </blockquote> In case a), the winner is the estate agent (he does not have to rent his
            flat to students), whereas in b) and c) it is the hunters that win, as they get to meet
            the estate agent on time and thus manage to find a flat. </para>

        <title>Game Modes</title>
        <para> There are four modes to play <projectname>Flat Hunt</projectname>:
            <emphasis>Hunt</emphasis>, <emphasis>Escape</emphasis>, <emphasis>Versus</emphasis> and
                <emphasis>Demo</emphasis>. Depending on the mode, zero
            (<emphasis>Versus</emphasis>), one
            (<emphasis>Hunt</emphasis>/<emphasis>Escape</emphasis>) or two
            (<emphasis>Demo</emphasis>) parts are taken over by the computer.</para>
        <para>
            <emphasis>Hunt</emphasis>: This is probably the most typical situation; the player tries
            to find the agent, which is played by the computer. Thus, the player only knows about
            every fifth move where the agent just was… The exact route of the agent can be seen at
            the bottom left (see Figure 6). The agent shows himself only in rounds number 1, 3, 8,
            13, 18, and 23. </para>
        <para>
            <emphasis>Escape</emphasis>: This is the exact opposite of <emphasis>Hunt
            mode</emphasis>: The agent is played by you, and the hunters are played by the computer.
            The hunters always move as close in your direction as possible, as they somehow manage
            to decode your transponder signal, and thus always know your precise location (so much
            for privacy…). You just have to try to avoid them as long as possible… </para>
        <para>
            <emphasis>Versus</emphasis>: This is the multiplayer mode. One of the players is the
            agent; the other plays all the hunters. While the player of the agent is making a move,
            the player of the hunters is supposed to look away… </para>
        <para>
            <emphasis>Demo</emphasis>: This mode is more or less the opposite of the buzzword
            “interactive”, but is about as entertaining as watching fish in an aquarium. The
            computer is playing against himself, trying to catch the agent as fast as possible.
