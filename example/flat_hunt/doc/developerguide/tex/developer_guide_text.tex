\paragraph{}
\emph{TRAFFIC} \cite{dgsa05}, \emph{Touch} \cite{dgrk05} and \emph{Flat Hunt} is software that hopefully makes learning to program more fun and more interesting for you. \emph{TRAFFIC} is a library that supports the reading and display of public transportation systems. A library is a piece of software whose functionality can be used by other software. \emph{Flat Hunt} is an application that uses the \emph{TRAFFIC} library to model a city map. For the visualization the \emph{EiffelMedia} Library (formerly known as \emph{ESDL} \cite{dgtgb03}\cite{dgbb04}) is used. It is a strategy game, similar to Scotland Yard, but with a different background story (for more information about the story and gameplay of \emph{Flat Hunt}, read the Flat Hunt User Guide). \emph{Touch} is also an application that uses the \emph{TRAFFIC} library. For more information on \emph{TRAFFIC} and \emph{Touch}: see \cite{dgsa05} and \cite{dgrk05} or visit \htmladdnormallink{this website}{http://se.inf.ethz.ch/traffic}.\\

  This document describes how \emph{Flat Hunt} is built, what classes are important and highlights some of their features.
