In the cluster Model, there are two important parent classes: Class \texttt{PLAYER} and class \texttt{BRAIN}. \texttt{PLAYER} is the parent of \texttt{FLAT\_HUNTER} and \texttt{ESTATE\_AGENT}, and \texttt{BRAIN} is the parent of \texttt{HUMAN}, \texttt{FLAT\_HUNTER\_BOT} and \texttt{ESTATE\_AGENT\_BOT}. These Model classes describe the internal representation of ``real world'' objects. Here is a description of some of these classes.
