When opening \emph{Flat Hunt} in EiffelStudio, the cluster view in the bottom left corner of EiffelStudio shows many clusters. For you only the top-level clusters \emph{Traffic} and \emph{Flat\_hunt} are important.\\

To remove complexity, \emph{Flat Hunt} is structured in three clusters (see Figure 1): \emph{Model}, \emph{View} and \emph{Controller}. In each cluster, there are several classes, and sometimes there are subclusters.
