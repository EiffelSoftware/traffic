Cluster Controller is the fundamental cluster in \emph{Flat Hunt}. Here are the classes that ``control'' the actions. They make sure that the displayer classes in cluster View display the proper information, which they get from the Model classes. For example, feature prepare in class \texttt{GAME} controls the display update by calling \texttt{current\_player.displayer.display\_after\_move}.
