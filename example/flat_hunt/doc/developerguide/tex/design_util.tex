Those classes that are not directly part of the game, but rather serve as utils, reside in the \textbf{Util} cluster. For one, there are several menu handling classes, which provide the functionality for a normal menu and an option menu. Also important are the helper classes like \texttt{TEXT\_BOX}, which allows to comfortably display status messages in a nice translucent box. And last but not least, a basic music player with shuffle function can be found here.
