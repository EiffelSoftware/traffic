This document is based upon its prior version, which was written by Michela Pedroni and Marcel Kessler (thanks!). All graphics for the game were designed by me and Photoshop. The code of \emph{Flat Hunt} is based on its prior version \cite{mk04}, which is mainly the work of Marcel Kessler. Major parts had to be rewritten by me though.\\

Thanks to Michela Pedroni for her assistance, all my predecessors for their work, Till G. Bay (and others) for the \emph{EiffelMedia} Library (formerly \emph{ESDL} \cite{dgtgb03}\cite{dgbb04}) and Bertrand Meyer for the \emph{Eiffel} language.
