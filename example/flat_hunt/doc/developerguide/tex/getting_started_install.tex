\emph{EiffelStudio}, as well as \emph{EiffelMedia}, come with an installer. Just follow the onscreen instructions like you would when installing any other program. No magic there..\\

\emph{TRAFFIC} does not need to be installed, just download the zip-file and unzip it to a directory of your choice.\\ 
Flat Hunt is located in the directory \texttt{traffic/example/flat\_hunt}. To get it to run, however, you'll have to compile it first.\\
