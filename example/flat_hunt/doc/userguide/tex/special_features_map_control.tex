Map control is fairly simple: you got two maps in a game scene, one of which only is a smaller version of the other one. The big map is on the left and that's where the action takes place, the little map on the right is meerely a navigation tool. To control the big map, use your mouse as follows:

  \begin{description}
    \item[left click:] only has an impact if clicked on a highlighted place
    \item[richt click + move mouse:] moves map in the direction of your mouse movement
    \item[middle click + move mouse up:] zoom in
    \item[middle click + move mouse down:] zoom out
  \end{description}

  When you \emph{left click + move mouse} in the little map, a red rectangle is drawn between the point where your left mouse button is pressed down and the point when its released. As soon as you release the mouse button, the map segment that is inside this rectangle gets displayed on the big map.
