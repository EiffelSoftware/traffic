\emph{As the title suggests (and the introduction mentions), it is all about finding a flat in Zurich\ldots}\\

However, this is not so easy\ldots There is this guy, the estate agent, who is renting flats. The problem is that he is always busy showing flats to other customers, and even in his office they don't really always know where exactly he is. The only thing they know is what kind of transport he is moving around with. This is because the estate agent is taking part in a new VBZ-project called ``Customer tracking''.\\

In collaboration with ETH, they equipped some volunteers with transponders. These transponders gather information like current position and type of transport, and send it in real-time to the office. However, for privacy reasons, only the type of transport can be accessed all the time.\\

Once in a while, the estate agent (Figure \ref{agent}) calls his office to tell the secretary which flat he is currently visiting. So sometimes, the people there in the office can tell ``you'' where to look for him\ldots ``You'' meaning yourself and your friends (Figure \ref{hunters}), the guys you want to share the flat with\ldots
