\emph{Flat Hunt} comes with an integrated music player and some default background music. Since not everyone likes the same sound, there is also the possibility to play your own.\\ 
Just put your \texttt{.ogg}-files in the directory \texttt{\$\{FLAT\_HUNT\}/resources/sound} before you start the Flat Hunt application. Flat Hunt will then automatically load all the \texttt{.ogg}-files from this directory and play them in alphabetical order (unless you enable shuffle, obviously). Music player control: see \ref{shortcuts} Keyboard Shortcuts.
