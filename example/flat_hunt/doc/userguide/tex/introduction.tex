Welcome to \emph{Flat Hunt}!

\paragraph{}
\emph{Flat Hunt} is a simple adaptation of the well-known board game ``Scotland Yard'' (see Figure \ref{screenshot}). Instead of some agents hunting Mr. X all around London, it is about a group of students starting off at ETH Zurich. To make their student life a bit more pleasant, they are desperately trying to find a flat in this little big city. But to get a flat, they must first meet the estate agent, who is running all around Zurich showing his flats to other people\ldots
