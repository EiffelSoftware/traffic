			In the following sections the classes will be described. The layout for each class is: 
			Requirements, Description, Class overview. In the Requirements the name of classes you 
			need to know in order to understand the class described is given. Description is a short 
			description of what the class does. It is more detailed than just the class description 
			that you find in the class header. The class overview provides you with a class diagram.

			This class is shared by all other classes in this section. It has some default values like <featurename>window_width</featurename>
			or <featurename>place_height</featurename>. It could be thought of if it's more useful to provide such values in their respective classes to
			get some more independance for the following classes. Another feature <featurename>map_to_gl_coords</featurename> can be found in this class.
			This feature translates given coordinates to coordinates according to the map.

    	<para>
			The TRAFFIC_3D_MAP_WIDGET class is the main class in this cluster. As seen in the overview it contains all the representations of buildings, 
			lines, places and travelers. It represents the whole map which can be plugged into a EM_3D_SCENE. It provides the feature <featurename>draw</featurename>. 
			Then for other classes there is a feature <featurename>collision_polygons</featurename> which is useful to search for a collision. 
			The feature <featurename>load_map</featurename> is used to load from a file and create all the lines and places. There is a map dump which is loaded instead 
			if there is such a map dump and this dump file is on date.
    	</para>
		<para>
			There are several features to add buildings <featurename>add_building</featurename>, <featurename>add_buildings</featurename>, <featurename>add_buildings_along_lines</featurename>, where one, several at random or several at a line are added.
			Then you can add a traveler through <featurename>add_traveler</featurename>. For all attributes there are corresponding setter methods.

			The class TRAFFIC_BUILDING_FACTORY is a factory for the 3D objects which represent the buildings on the map. The interface is for each of the factories the same: With the features <featurename>add_gauger</featurename> and <featuername>remove_gauger</featuername> one can handle procedures for decisions. These procedures can then be called through the feature <featurename>take_decision</featurename> which calls the right gauger and saves the decision in the string <featurename>decision</featurename>. For creating a  representation of the built object one can add specific procedures through the features <featurename>add_line_type</featurename> and remove them by calling <featurename>remove_line_type</featurename>. The last two features are the feature <featurename>specify_object</featurename> which takes the right line type according to the decision and the feature <featurename>create_object</featurename> which is inherited from EM_3D_OBJECT_FACTORY and returns the created object.

			<featurename>draw_shortest_line</featurename> draws it. Lines can be highlithed or un-highlighted by calling the features
			<featurename>highlight_single_line</featurename>, <featurename>un_highlight_single_line</featurename> and similar ones. With the feature <featurename>add_lines</featurename> all lines
			of a map can be added, but single lines can be added too.

			In principle this class is a factory as well. It is used to create ".obj" files. As for now it is not possible to make one factory and make several loads. Therefore everytime 
			a 3D object should be created a new factory has to be created too (what isn't the meaning of a factory at all). The feature <featurename>set_em_color</featurename> sets the color of a created object.
			The feature <featurename>load_file</featurename> is used to load a new file, other than the original feature this feature closes it's opened files after use.
			The feature <featurename>specify_object</featurename> specifies the object according to the loaded file and the given color.

			Like all other container the feature <featurename>draw</featurename> is also provided to draw all travelers. To add a traveler call <featurename>add_traveler</featurename>. 
			As there are no travelers provided in the map you have to provide the TRAFFIC_MAP to add this traveler. The feature <featurename>remove_traveler</featurename> removes a walking traveler
			from the map, the feature <featurename>remove_specific_traveler</featurename> does the same by comparing the given traveler with all others in the container. If found it is removed.
			There is a feature <featurename>add_trams_per_line</featurename> which adds the given number or maximal trams to each line.
