    <title>Traffic map overview</title>
    <para> Let us start with a short overview of the <projectname>Traffic library</projectname>.
		The <projectname>Traffic library</projectname> was written to model a city and its public transportation system. 
		Therefore you can imagine the library delivering you with all you need to build and 
		work on a city map. This map can contain places with landmarks and public transportation 
		lines. The library provides you with all you need and you even can get a tour through 
		the city visiting all your places of interest. The overall model of the library is shown 
		in the following figure.

    	As is visible from the picture, the most important class is the TRAFFIC_MAP class. It 
    	describes the map of a city and its public transportation system. Such a map consists
    	of places and traffic transportation lines. Those lines in turn are made up of line 
    	sections. With this knowledge you can already build a map!
