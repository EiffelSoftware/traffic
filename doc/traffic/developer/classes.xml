    <title>The Story</title>
    <para>
        <emphasis>As the title suggests (and the introduction mentions), it is all about finding a
            flat in Zurich…</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para> However, this is not so easy… There is this guy, the estate agent, who is renting flats.
        The problem is that he is always busy showing flats to other customers, and even in his
        office they don’t really always know where exactly he is. The only thing they know is what
        kind of transport he is moving around with. This is because the estate agent is taking part
        in a new VBZ-project called “Customer tracking”. </para>
    <para> In collaboration with ETH, they equipped some volunteers with transponders. These
        transponders gather information like current position and type of transport, and send it in
        real-time to the office. However, for privacy reasons, only the type of transport can be
        accessed all the time. </para>
    <para> Once in a while, the estate agent (<emphasis>Figure 2</emphasis>) calls his office to
        tell the secretary which flat he is currently visiting. So sometimes, the people there in
        the office can tell the flat hunters (<emphasis>Figure 3</emphasis>) where to look for him…</para>
