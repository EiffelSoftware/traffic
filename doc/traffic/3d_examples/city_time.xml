<title>City_time application</title>
<section id="introduction">
    <para> Welcome to <projectname>City_Time</projectname>! </para>
	<para>
	The <projectname>City_Time</projectname> application displays traffic lines as
	colored polygons on a plane, adds passengers on this plane randomly, trams on their respective lines and provides 
	mouse and keyboard support such that changing the viewpoint (zooming, 
	different centres) is possible (easily). Moreover it runs time in the model.

	<title>Mouse controls</title>
	<para>
	 i) Mouse wheel:
	Controls the zooming factor, whereas the position stays invariant. 
	There are two different zooming speeds depending on the distance to the plane.
	</para>
	<para>
	 ii) Mouse click:
	Is used to mark stations on the map. The origin can be marked with the 
	left mouse button, the destination with the right one. If the user clicks 
	on an empty spot, the marked stations are revoked.
	</para>
	<para>
	 iii) Mouse dragging:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>
                Left mouse button: By dragging the mouse while pressing the left 
                button one is able to translate the position of the map in the 
                window, i.e. move the plane.
            </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>
                Right mouse button: By dragging the mouse while pressing the right 
                button one is able to rotate the map around the the origin.
            </para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
	</para>
	<para>
	 iv) Keyboard:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>
                By pressing the up-/down- or left-/right- arrow keys the map will be rotated around the x- or y-axis respectively.
            </para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>
                By pressing the enter key the translation will be reset to its initial value. However, zoom as well as rotation aren't affected.
            </para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

	<para>
		<para>
			i) Start the time count. At the bottom of the toolbar you see the time going up. The trams (no changes possible) and the passengers
			start to move on the map. The simulated time is shown below and can vary from 5 to 60 minutes.
		</para>
		<para>
	 		ii) Change the number of passengers to be displayed on the map: The number of passengers can be varied from 0 up to 1000. 
	 		The passengers are randomly distributed.
