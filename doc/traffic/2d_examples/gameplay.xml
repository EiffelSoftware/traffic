        <title>General Rules</title>
        <para> The game lasts for at most 23 rounds. In these 23 rounds, the flat hunters try to
            find the estate agent, while he tries to avoid them (this is because he would rather
            rent the flats to elderly couples, since presumably they make fewer parties in the
            middle of the night...). </para>
        <para> In each round, every player can make one move on the public transport system. The
            estate agent is the first, then it's the hunters' turn. One move is either </para>

                    <para> one stop by train (thick orange lines), </para>

                    <para> or one stop by bus (thin light blue lines). </para>

            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <para> A move with a certain transport can only be made if one has still enough tickets
                (<emphasis>see Figure 4</emphasis>), if there is a connection (obviously), and if
            there is no other player at that destination (and in the case of tram lines, if there is
            no hunter in between). </para>
        <para>
            <note> Attention! If you are at a bus-only stop (or tram-only stop for that matter), and
                you run out of bus tickets (or tram tickets respectively), you will get stuck there
                forever, so be careful...</note>

        <para> The possible places you can move to are colored yellow (<emphasis>see Figure
            5</emphasis>). To make a move, just click on one of those highlighted places. The red
            circle centers on the player whose turn it is, and in the status box at the right, the
            game status and information about the current player get displayed. If you want to know
            the status of another player just click on his picture at the bottom. Click again to
            close the just opened status box.</para>

        <para> In case a), the winner is the estate agent (he does not have to rent his flat to
            students), whereas in b) and c) it is the hunters that win, as they get to meet the
            estate agent on time and thus manage to find a flat. </para>

        <title>Game Modes</title>
        <para> There are four modes to play <projectname>Flathunt</projectname>:
            <keyword>Hunt</keyword>, <keyword>Escape</keyword>, <keyword>Versus</keyword> and
                <keyword>Demo</keyword>. Depending on the mode, zero (<keyword>Versus</keyword>),
            one (<keyword>Hunt</keyword>/<keyword>Escape</keyword>) or two (<keyword>Demo</keyword>)
            parts are taken over by the computer.</para>
        <para>
            <keyword>Hunt</keyword>: This is probably the most typical situation; the player tries
            to find the agent, which is played by the computer. Thus, the player only knows about
            every fifth move where the agent just was... The agent shows himself only in rounds
            number 3, 8, 13, 18, and 23. In these rounds, the exact route of the agent is displayed
            under <keyword>History</keyword> in the status box at the bottom right corner and in
            the estate agent's own status box if opened. In all other rounds you only see the
            detailed history up to the round the estate agent last showed himself. As soon as the
            agent has come out of hiding for the first time, a dimmed version of his picture will
            always be shown at the location he was last sighted.</para>
        <para>
            <keyword>Escape</keyword>: This is the exact opposite of <keyword>Hunt</keyword> mode:
            The agent is played by you, and the hunters are played by the computer. The hunters
            always move as close in your direction as possible, as they somehow manage to decode
            your transponder signal, and thus always know your precise location (so much for
            privacy...). You just have to try to avoid them as long as possible... </para>
        <para>
            <keyword>Versus</keyword>: This is the multiplayer mode. One of the players is the
            agent; the other plays all the hunters. While the player of the agent is making a move,
            the player of the hunters is supposed to look away... </para>
        <para>
            <keyword>Demo</keyword>: This mode is more or less the opposite of the buzzword
            "interactive", but is about as entertaining as watching fish in an aquarium. The
            computer is playing against himself, trying to catch the agent as fast as possible.
