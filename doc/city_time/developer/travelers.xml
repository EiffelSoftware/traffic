	The class <classname cluster="city_3d">TRAFFIC_TRAVELER_REPRESENTATION</classname> is responsible for distributing travelers of all kind on the plane.

	<title>Travelers distribution</title>
	<para>
	As there is a traffic_traveler object always associated to the 3D object which is drawn in this class the position of each travelers is given by it's corresponding traveler.
	Because of performance reasons the traveler stores it's position according to the position on the map (the traveler uses the feature <featurename class="city_3d.building_ewer">map_to_gl_coords</featurename> by itself).
	As one should be able to change the map and it's size there should be something provided.  
	<title>Adding travelers</title>
	<para>
	A 3D passenger object can be added to the map by giving
	calling the add_traveler feature with a corresponding TRAFFIC_TRAVELER object. As for the use of the traffic model the feature  <featurename class="city_3d.building_ewer">add_trams_per_line</featurename> is provided which 
	adds 'number' trams to the lines of 'a_map'. There can only be as many trams per line as there are stops.
