	<title>Description</title>
	<para>
	The class <classname cluster="city_3d">BUILDING_EWER</classname> is responsible for distributing buildings on the plane.
	It takes the number of buildings from the map and places the according number 
	of buildings on the plane using a random number generator and a collision detection, 
	which checks for collisions with traffic lines. It stores the created objects (buildings) in a container 
	and provides a feature to the map object that does the necessary drawing.
	</para>
	<title>Building distribution</title>
	<para>
	First, the centre of the new building is calculated using the random number generator. 
	Next, the collision polygon is created with these coordinates. Then the feature <featurename class="city_3d.building_ewer">has_collision</featurename>
	checks for collisions with the polygons of the traffic lines that have been created earlier in the creation procedure. 
	If there are any collisions, the coordinates are discarded and new ones calculated. If not, the distance to the centre is calculated and the building created using the factory and a gauger of your choice. Finally, the building is set to the right position and put into the container where it is stored. 
	</para>
	<title>Adding buildings</title>
	<para>
	If the slidebar is moved and additional buildings have to be displayed, <featurename class="city_3d.building_ewer">set_building_number</featurename>
	calculates how many and calls <featurename class="city_3d.building_ewer">add_buildings</featurename>, which takes the random number generator and the 
	container of the buildings that have already been created and adds the difference to it. Similarly, if less buildings should be displayed, 
	i.e. the slidebar is moved left, the container stays the same and only the feature <featurename class="city_3d.building_ewer">draw</featurename>, 
	which is essentially a loop over the container and a draw call to all the items, is changed by setting 
	a new upper limit.
