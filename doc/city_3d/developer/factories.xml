	This class is a factory for creating displayable representations of <classname cluster="traffic">TRAFFIC_LINE</classname> objects. 
	It inherits from <classname cluster="em.video.object_factory">EM_3D_OBJECT_FACTORY</classname> which provides the necessary structures such as the feature <featurename class="em.video.object_factory.em_3d_object_factory">create_object</featurename> or <featurename class="em.video.object_factory.em_3d_object_factory">specify_object</featurename>. <featurename class="city_3d.traffic_3d_line_factory">specify_object</featurename> contains the (OpenGL) commands to create the object and has to be implemented. To actually create and draw an object, the feature <featurename class="city_3d.traffic_3d_line_factory">create_object</featurename> of the factory is called, which returns a <classname cluster="em.video">EM_3D_OBJECT</classname>. Then, the origin and scale of this object is set and the feature <featurename class="em.video.em_3d_object">draw</featurename> of the object is called.

	<title>Building a line</title>
	<para>
	Each line segment is drawn independently, putting a circle at the beginning and the end to indicate that 
	there are stations. Next, the 'polypoints' list is traversed and for each two points a rectangle of 
	width <featurename class="city_3d.shared_constants">line_width</featurename> is created. These rectangles are connected with circles again, but smaller as the ones representing the stations.
