	<para>
	The intention of this class is to collect information that would be spread over the whole project otherwise. 
	This helps adjusting the project and makes minor changes easier, as a constant (like <featurename class="city_3d.shared_constants">line_width</featurename>) only has to be changed a single time to take effects on the whole project. 
	All classes that want to use constants or procedures from <classname cluster="city_3d">SHARED_CONSTANTS</classname> inherit from this class, 
	but do not export the inherited features so that they are not visible in the interface.
	</para>
	<title>Constants</title>
	<para>
	In addition to constants of minor importance, such as line-/window- height and width, the most important one is <featurename class="city_3d.shared_constants">plane_size</featurename> which is used 
	mostly in the classes <classname cluster="city_3d">MAP</classname> and <classname cluster="city_3d">BUILDING_EWER</classname> for calculations related to the 
	distribution of buildings and other issues.
	</para>
	<title>map_to_gl_coords</title>
	<para>
	This query is of great importance to the project as it maps the coordinates in the XML files that vary from 0 to 1500 to the coordinates of the plane, 
	which are in the range of -plane_size/2 to +plane_size/2. 
	All coordinate transformations that have to be done call this procedure. This makes an adjustment to new coordinates in an XML file pretty easy, 
	because only this feature would have to be changed.
