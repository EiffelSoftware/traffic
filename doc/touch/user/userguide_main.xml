	TOUCH implements some of the examples of the book ''Touch of Class''. 
	
	<!--
	Note that the examples as described in TOUCH are not totally equivalent 
	to their description in the text book. At the time of this writing not 
	all the examples of the book are implemented yet. So TOUCH needs to be 
	taken with a pinch of salt!

			How does this application work?
		</title>
		<para>
			Each chapter respectively each example has its own application. All examples look almost the 
			same, except for some minor changes to meet the requirements of the individual exercise. 
			The window contains a square to display the map and a control panel at the right side. 
			The control panel consists of two parts: One is for navigating throuch the map using for 
			example zoom in or zoom out and the other is the console where possible output is displayed. 
			
			Dependant on the exercise there are more buttons to click (for example a restart button etc.).
