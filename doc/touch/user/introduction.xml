        that you find in the book. <emphasis>A Touch of Class</emphasis> is used to teach programming to
        students in the first semester. The examples are based on <libraryname>TRAFFIC</libraryname>

        transportation connections. The visual presentation is done using <libraryname>EiffelMedia</libraryname>
