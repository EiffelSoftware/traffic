        <para>In the textbook A Touch Of Class there are some example applications. The Touch library contains some simplifications so that Traffic does not overwhelm you. Please skip this section if you don't want to use Touch.</para>

Or you can use the provided application to create a Touch application. The application just asks a few things like the name of yor application and does everything by itself.</para>
